  "cwe": "CWE-327",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA & ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.",

  "statement": "Signature verification using Elliptic Curve Cryptography in Nettle has been found to be vulnerable to various Out of Bound memory access if the signature provided was specially crafted. The result may lead to assertion failure (Denial of Service), or have unspecified consequences.\nCurves known to have been affected : ECDSA (all the NIST curves) & GOST curves. Some EdDSA curves (ed25519 and ed448) may have been affected as well.",
